If you're interested in learning more about my current research, then you should check out two of my recent talks:
* Astronomy Colloquium at the [MIT Kavli Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtZKWqzD9S0) on April 15, 2025,
* Talk and Q&A for the [NASA Galaxies Science Interest Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imj-CGE1EOU)

These are quite different. The first (MIT Colloquium) is an overview of my research and includes about 45 minutes of all the different things I do. The second (NASA Galaxies SIG) is more focused on mechanistic interpretability and AI for scientific discovery.
