If you're interested in learning more about my current research, then you should check out my recent talks:
* Astronomy Colloquium at the [**MIT Kavli Institute**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtZKWqzD9S0) on April 15, 2025
* Talk and Q&A for the [**NASA Galaxies Science Interest Group**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imj-CGE1EOU) on May 7, 2025

These two talks are pretty different. 

The first ([MIT Colloquium](https://www.space.mit.edu/events/john-wu/)) is a 50-minute overview of my research program and includes everything from computer vision to low-mass galaxies to graph neural networks.

The second ([NASA Galaxies SIG](https://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/sigs/galsig/events/seminars/May-07-2025/07-May-2025.php)) comprises a 30 minute presentation, followed by 30+ minutes of discussion on galaxy scaling laws, mechanistic interpretability, and AI for scientific discovery.
