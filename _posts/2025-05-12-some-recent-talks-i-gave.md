If you're interested in learning more about my current research, I recently gave two invited talks:
* Astronomy Colloquium at the [MIT Kavli Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtZKWqzD9S0) on April 15, 2025,
* Talk and Q&A for the [NASA Galaxies Science Interest Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imj-CGE1EOU)
