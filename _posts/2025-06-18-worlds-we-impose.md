In the book **Impro**, Keith Johnstone recounts a moment between a teacher and a special needs student. The teacher holds up a flower and says, "Look at the pretty flower." The girl responds, "All of the flowers are beautiful." Then the teacher insists, "but this flower is especially beautiful." The girl then proceeds to lose it and scream.

Johnstone saw violence in this exchange, but not from the student:

> In the gentlest possible way, this teacher had been very violent. She was insisting on categorising, and on selecting. Actually it is crazy to insist that one flower is especially beautiful in a whole garden of flowers, but the teacher is allowed to do this, and is not perceived by sane people as violent. Grown-ups are expected to distort the perceptions of the child in this way. Since then I've noticed such behaviour constantly, but it took the mad girl to open my eyes to it.

The rejection of a another's world. Gentle, violent, imposition.

As a father of two, I have to resist this urge. My child sees something worth sharing, and I instinctively want to shape their perspective. Or convert their offerings into some teaching moment, a piece of my reality. Keith calls this "blocking" and discusses it throughout the book, mostly in the context of improvisation and theatre.

This has been on my mind because I practice it daily now. If you (adroitly) use AI, then you probably do as well. 

To get any utility out of a large language model, you need to become that teacher. You construct its world: context, constraints, persona, objective. Prompting is exactly what we've describe above: your reality pressed onto the machine until it complies.

Not all correction carries this violence, of course. Parents pull children from traffic. The AI safety community works to align these tools with human values. We need guidance for children and for machines, so the crux of the question isn't about whether we should guide others. Rather, I'm more concerned about what it does to my *own* psyche.

What happens when you spend hours each day practicing this second kind of imposition on something that never resists? AI interaction is unceasing compliance (and gross sycophancy... but hopefully we're getting past that stage). Real life is never this frictionless, and for good reason. Otherwise, our mindsets would become ever more static, our society increasingly siloed. Other factors, e.g., social media, have already eroded away our ability to accept genuine dissent, or internalize other world view.

What do we stop seeing when we get too good at making others see things our way? The goal of improv[^1] is to accept what your partner gives you (the "yes, and..." principle), and build on it. This probably won't be too helpful for interacting with LLMs, but I've recognized a personal need to practice this in the real world (especially as I've gotten older): not to stop providing guidance, but to intentionally open myself to other perspectives.
