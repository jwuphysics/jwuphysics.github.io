I am a tenure-track assistant astronomer at STScI working in the Roman Telescope Branch of the Instruments Division. I am also an Associate Research Scientist in the Center for Astrophysical Sciences at JHU.

My research focuses on studying galaxies with multi-wavelength observations and machine learning. I am particularly interested in using graph neural networks (CNNs) to represent galaxies amidst their large scale environments, and using convolutional neural networks (GNNs) to encode the connection between galaxy appearances and their other properties.
