I am a tenure-track Assistant Astronomer at Space Telescope Science Institute ([STScI](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/john-f-wu)) working in the Roman Telescope Branch of the Instruments Division. I am also an Associate Research Scientist in the Center for Astrophysical Sciences at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

My [research](research/) focuses on studying galaxies with multi-wavelength observations and machine learning. I am particularly interested in using **graph neural networks** (GNNs) to represent galaxies amidst their large scale environments, and using **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to encode the connection between galaxy appearances and their other properties. Please take a look at some recent [selected papers](papers/) or my up-to-date [publication list](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/cEIZdS8tReiOS8sKk7LR7g).
