I am a tenure-track [Assistant Astronomer at Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/john-f-wu) working in the Roman Telescope Branch of the Instruments Division. I am also an Associate Research Scientist in the Center for Astrophysical Sciences at Johns Hopkins University.

My [research](research/) focuses on studying galaxies with multi-wavelength observations and machine learning. I am particularly interested in using **graph neural networks** (GNNs) to represent galaxies amidst their large scale environments, and using **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to encode the connection between galaxy appearances and their other properties. Please take a look at [some recent selected papers](papers/) or my [up-to-date publication list](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/sWDDqHsPT1up8qCFIHGdig). My [research blog](https://jwuphysics.substack.com/) may also have interesting tidbits, although I haven't written there in a while.

I recently helped coordinate a [KITP program on Data-Driven Astronomy (*galevo23*)](https://datadrivengalaxyevolution.github.io/), which featured some very nice tutorials and talks. We covered topics like simulation-based inference, GNNs, symbolic regression, probabilistic U-nets, and much more. All machine learning tutorials can be accessed on [Github](https://github.com/DataDrivenGalaxyEvolution/galevo23-tutorials/).
