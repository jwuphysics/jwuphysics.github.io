I am interested in understanding how galaxies grow and evolve, from low-mass satellite galaxies in the low-redshift universe to massive galaxies residing in enormous clusters. By using a combination of multi-wavelength observations, wide-area surveys, and machine learning techniques, my research group studies the interplay of galaxies' internal physical processes galaxy and their environments.

## Graph Neural Networks

Graph neural networks, or GNNs, are remarkably adept at representing galaxies and their physical interactions admist large scale structure. We have successfully used GNNs to augment the galaxy-halo connection by incorporating information from galaxy surroundings on 3-5 Mpc scales.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, can represent complex morphological information in images. Because galaxy appearances encode their physical properties and formation history, we can train CNNs to extract information that might otherwise be only accesible via spectroscopic observations or detailed physical modeling. For example, we are able to estimate galaxy spectra directly from image cutouts ([Wu & Peek 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200912318W/abstract)).
