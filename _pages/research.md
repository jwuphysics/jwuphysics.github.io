Mu research group seeks to understanding how galaxies grow and evolve, from low-mass satellite galaxies in the low-redshift universe to massive galaxies residing in enormous clusters. We study the interplay of galaxies' internal physical processes galaxy and their environments by using wide-area astronomical surveys, and simulation data, targeted multi-wavelength observations, and machine learning techniques.

## Graph Neural Networks

Graph neural networks, or GNNs, are remarkably adept at representing galaxies and their physical interactions admist large scale structure. We have successfully used GNNs to augment the galaxy-halo connection by incorporating information from galaxy surroundings on [several-Mpc scales](files/GNN-poster.pdf). My collaborators and I are continuing to push on this novel and exciting line of research!

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, can represent complex morphological information in images. Because galaxy appearances encode their physical properties and formation history, we can train CNNs to extract information that might otherwise be only accesible via spectroscopic observations or detailed physical modeling. For example, we are able to [predict galaxy optical spectra directly from image cutouts](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200912318W/abstract)). 

By using CNNs, we can also estimate galaxies' [gas metallicities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.4683W/abstract), [neutral hydrogen content](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900..142W/abstract), [nuclear activity](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914..142H/abstract), and [excitation state](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221207881G/abstract). We have also found CNNs to be useful for [enhancing X-ray observations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...60S/abstract) and [removing artifacts from photometric catalogs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165..123D/abstract).

## Low-mass Galaxies
Low-mass galaxies are vital for studying galaxy formation physics, because they are so sensitive to feedback processes and are easily disrupted by interactions with other (more massive) galaxies. In the very local Universe (*z* < 0.03) we are discovering many new low-mass galaxy candidates with [machine learning](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..121W/abstract), and targeting them for [spectroscopic confirmation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221207433D/abstract) as part of a DESI survey.


## Gas in Diverse Galaxy Populations
As part of [my thesis work](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/62065/), I studied the star-forming interstellar medium of galaxies across a diverse range of environments. These galaxy populations include [members of massive clusters](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...853..195W/abstract), [Lyman break galaxy analogs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887..251W/abstract), and [neutral hydrogen-rich galaxies at *z* > 1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016mks..confE...4B/abstract).
