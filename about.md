I am a tenure-track *Associate Astronomer* at STScI, and hold the title of Data Science Mission Office (DSMO) *Applied AI Scientist*. I am also an *Associate Research Scientist* in JHU Center for Astrophysical Sciences and the JHU Department of Computer Science.

My research focuses on studying galaxies with multi-wavelength observations, machine learning, and interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) for scientific discovery. I am particularly interested in using **graph neural networks** (GNNs) to represent galaxies and their large-scale surroundings, and using interpretable **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to encode the connection between galaxy appearances and their physical properties. I co-lead the [Chesapeake ML-Astro](https://chesapeakemlastro.github.io/) research group and am a member of the [ISM*@ST](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home) group.

In 2024, I was named the [Maryland Outstanding Young Scientist](https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-019).
