I am a tenure-track *Associate Astronomer* at STScI, and hold the title of Data Science Mission Office (DSMO) *Applied AI Scientist*. I am also an *Associate Research Scientist* in JHU Center for Astrophysical Sciences and the JHU Department of Computer Science. In 2024, I was named the [Maryland Outstanding Young Scientist](https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-019).

My research focuses on studying galaxies with multi-wavelength observations, machine learning, and interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) for scientific discovery. I am particularly interested in using **graph neural networks** (GNNs) to represent galaxies and their large-scale surroundings, and using interpretable **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to encode the connection between galaxy appearances and their physical properties. I co-lead the [Chesapeake ML-Astro](https://chesapeakemlastro.github.io/) research group and am a member of the [ISM*@ST](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home) group. 

I maintain a [blog](https://jwuphysics.github.io/blog/) where I post on topics like:
- [GNNs in astrophysics](https://jwuphysics.github.io/blog/2025/06/graph-neural-networks-in-astrophysics/)
- [Foundation models in astronomy](https://jwuphysics.github.io/blog/2025/05/foundation-models-in-astronomy/)
- [Some ways I use LLMs](https://jwuphysics.github.io/blog/2025/04/four-ways-i-use-llms/)
- [Two years in the tenure track](https://jwuphysics.github.io/blog/2024/01/two-years-in-the-tenure-track/)
